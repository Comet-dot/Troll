# Troll
I created this when i was bored, i don't know how to code properly but i had fun writing the program.

# Installation
The installation is simple, you have to download the [last release](https://github.com/ImAWildDogg/Troll/releases/) and extract the .zip file in a new folder then run the .py file.

# Dependencies 
For now you wil just need Tkinter (`pip install tk`).

# Customization 
For now you can only customize background color and the window name, if you want to change the background color you have to edit the 6th line of code and the 10th line writing a supported color (the default color is purple).

In order to customize the window name you need to edit the 5th line (by default the window name is Get trolled). 
# P.S.
i dont know if it runs on linux or mac os because i tested it only on windows, If it runs on other os let me know!

You can modify and use the program how much you want! Have fun.
