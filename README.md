# Troll
I created this when i was bored, i don't know how to code properly but i had fun writing the program.

# Installation
The installation is simple, you have to download the [last release](https://github.com/ImAWildDogg/Troll/releases/) and extract the .zip file in a new folder then run the .py file.

# P.S.
You can modify and use the program how much you want! Have fun.
